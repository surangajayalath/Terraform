### Terraform

- Initialize the directory - When you create a new configuration — or check out an existing configuration from version control — you need to initialize the directory with terraform init
```
terraform init
```
- The terraform fmt command automatically updates configurations in the current directory for readability and consistency.
```
terraform fmt
```
- You can also make sure your configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent by using the terraform validate command.
```
terraform validate
```
- Apply the configuration now with the terraform apply command. 
```
terraform apply
```
- Inspect state
```
terraform show
```
